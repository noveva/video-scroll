Video-scroll experiment
============


# Overview
This project was supposed to be a jQuery plugin allowing to control video playback by scroll. Thus, no jQuery link in the head tag - no fun with scrolling video playback.

# Features
The plugin has three main features:
- link video playback to scroll movement;
- show progress of video playback with a progress bar on top of the screen;
- displays text or other elements at certain moments of video playback.

# Structure
There are two files you need to make it work:
- video.js: responsible for all the functionality, don't forget to link your video to that file.
- video.css: created to enable you choose one of the two modes how to display the video: as a background-video
or a the user might choose to customize it himself.
