video-scroll
============
#H1 Overview
This project was supposed to be a jQuery plugin allowing to control video playback by scroll. Thus, no jQuery link in the head tag - no fun with scrolling video playback.

#H1 Features
The plugin has three main features:
- link video playback to scroll movement;
- show progress of video playback with a progress bar on top of the screen;
- displays text or other elements at certain moments of video playback.

#H1 Structure
There are two files you need to make it work:
- video.js: responsible for all the functionality, don't forget to link your video to that file.í°†ô°Šô°ˆô°ô°Œô°ƒô°‚ô°ô°–ô°ô°˜ô°‘ô°‹ô°‚ô°ˆô° ô°ô°ô°ô°ô°…ô°‹ô°
